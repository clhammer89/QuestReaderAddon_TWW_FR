# WoW - Quest Reader Add The War Within French language pack

# Note - This only works with The War Within quests, so far.
World of Warcraft addon that reads quest text using a similar voice as the NPC quest giver. Each quest text dialogue has a generated audio file that was read using an AI voicemodel generated from their in-game audio. This repository/addon is a sound pack for "The War Within" wow expansion in the French language.

# Installation:
For this language pack to work you will need both the Quest Reader addon and the Quest Reader Addon The War Within French language pack.

Please download the latest release of the base Quest Reader addon at: https://github.com/clhammer89/wow-questreader/releases or https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questreaderaddon

Please download the latest release of the Quest Reader Addon The War Within French language pack at: https://github.com/clhammer89/wow-questreaderaddon_tww_fr/releases

If you are using Curseforge, just downloading and installing using the Curseforge addon manager is the easiest way to install. No extra steps there.

If you are downloading via Github, after downloading the Quest Reader Addon The War Within French language pack, extract the zip file and copy the folder to your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns folder.


# Usage:
This will add a "Read Quest" button to the bottom of the quest frame that will read the quest. There are also some Addon options for enabling/disabling the minimap icon and toggling auto-read on or off.

If you are using a quest UI addon like Immersion make sure to turn auto-play on.

# /Commands:

# BUGS
 - Missing quests. If you receive "Quest sound file not found: " or "Failed to play audio: " the quest is missing. Feel free to shoot me a comment with the missing quest ID and I'll add it to the list. 
 - Missing quests cont. The source I utilize for quest info can sometimes take several days before it has complete info. I try to source new quests every day, so if one is missing it may be added the next.
